Hi there welcome to the my React chat app. I built it for ASAPP.

It's pretty easy to get started.

Just clone the app.

```
git clone git@github.com:abeaudoin2013/asapp-test.git
```

Install npm.

```
npm install
```

Run npm start.

```
npm start
```

You will then be in an extremely engaging conversation between Rob Thomas and Laura Dern!
